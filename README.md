# Code Quiz

# A typical coding assessment with multiple-choice questions 

Code Quiz is an application which was assigned as the homework for week 4 of Monash University Bootcamp.

This Challenge invites to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions where the user will be rewarded with five points for each correct answer and take away 10seconds for each wrong answer, for a 60seconds challenge 

This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes
